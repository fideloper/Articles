I blog what I learn. This gives me a body of reference for myself, and the ability to go back in time and see all that I've accomplished. It's public so it can (hopefully) help others as well.

# Some Projects

## [How EE works](http://howeeworks.info)

I work with ExpressionEngine *every* day. One thing EE lacks is a very high-level (Project-manager-friendly) explanation of how everything fits together. This project is my attempt to address that. The technical and the non-technical should be able to communicate.

All code and content is found on [Github](https://github.com/fideloper/How-EE-Works), and remains open for contribution. The use of Markdown was deliberate, so as to provide the EE community with and easy way to edit, correct or add content to the project.

## [Markdown API](https://github.com/fideloper/Markdown-api)

This is a `Node.js` project built on `Express.js`. It is a simple API which returns HTML based on Markdown, and as parsed by [PHP-Markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown). Possibly soon to implement the Extra branch and other features missing in the PHP Marker processors. See also [supporting website](https://github.com/fideloper/Markdown-web) project.

## [Node Remote Control](https://github.com/fideloper/node-remotecontrol)

A `Node.js` proof-of-concept which allows a user to connect to the site (hopefully on their smart phone) and control a video being displayed. Using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io and the `Vimeo Froogloop API`, a user can connect to, start, stop and reload a video.

This is a feature/interaction that sites like Hulu as well as web-enabled TVs should have.

## [Earthquake](https://github.com/fideloper/Earthquake)

Another `Node.js` project built with Expres.js. This uses `Twitter's streaming API` to search for the term "Earthquake". It stores all such tweets with Geo-location data in a `MongoDB` database. 

One iteration (older, not on github) allows a user connected to the site to view tweets as they appears on a full-page map, using `Google Maps API`. This way a user can see tweets as they are being created. Useful to keep up on global seimic activity and as a social experiment.
