# Why I Love Markdown

Markdown is a simple syntax anyone can use to generate valid HTML. It uses plain-text in combination with characters such as hashes, tick marks, spaces, tabs and numbers. A writer can use this system to create a text file which is readable and understandable in itself, and see it produce clean, valid HTML.

## Not just another WYSIWYG

Usage on web, ease of implementation. Store as files. Print to PDF. Github usage. Documents. Books.

## Powerful Social Collaboration

Rise on Git, use as content [buzzword] for sites (howtonode, blog software powers it).

It's clean, less troublesome than a WYSIWYG, and allows developers such our myself to embed / add HTML within the content. (For the most part - read this http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#html )

To that end, I've used Markdown files to power many simple sites, such as this one and [howeeworks.info](http://howeeworks.com). 


EASE OF CONTRIBUTION. Ideas such as howtonode == possible future of collaboration. Social coding, and social copy editing. Markdown can provide that.
