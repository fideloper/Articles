#Where do all the developers go?

####What is the career track of the developer?

Developers start developing because they love to learn new things. Everything is new, unexplored, and relatively easy. Everything is **fun**.

#####Developing is a young-mans game.

As a developer gets more experienced, they slow their pace of learning new things. Less things are new, and new things are time-consuming. The current things need to get done, and responsibilties have been piled on. They have become part developer, part project manager, and part employee manager.

Learning the new things comes with a real tangible cost against family, friends, loved ones and, of course, workload. Working all hours is no longer possible without costing a developer dealy in all other places in their lives.
