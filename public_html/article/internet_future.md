#The web is smaller, everywhere. Build more APIs

Let's start with three premises:

1. Network availability is appearing on increasingly smaller devices
2. Network availability is appearing on increasingly varied devices.
3. Big data is not getting smaller.

#####Smaller Devices
Internet availability was first on large servers, then on personal computers, followed by laptops, now on all of our phones, and soon on much smaller devices. The size of devices in which we cam cram wires and antennaes is shrinking, and so we'll soon see Hot Wheels we can control from our iPhone.

#####All Devices
Parallelly, we're seeing internet available on more and more devices. Vehicle dashboards, washing machines, televisions, refrigerators and home security are just a few places where network access have been showing up.

#####Big Data
Giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and thousands of smaller<sup>1</sup> companies are collecting data on us when we use their applications. All of this data is used to profit from us by giving them better ways to give us valuable products. For instance, Google gives us better search results knowing our location. Amazon.com gives us recommendations by collecting data on similar-minded people. Twitter gives us follow recomendations based on (one hopes) our interests. There is a lot of data.

<sup>1</sup>smaller is a *very* relative term.

All this means that computers are getting smaller, and being put everywhere. This means that there will be even more data - Maytag could easily collect data on our laundry habits and send that data to their datacenters.

Big Data will be the driving force behind many next-generation applications. However, how that big-data is used will be interesting. Just like voice commands to Siri are sent off to be processed before returned to your iPhone, the processing of all this data will likely be passed off to data-centers. 

The end-user devices, being both small and not particularly powerful (Your washing machine has to makes primary function of washing your clothes a priority, after all) will be relatively dumb, but backed by a very intelligent data set. 

> The intelligence will be beamed to our devices with APIs, connecting the device to the data.

API usage is exploding, and will continue to explode. Until our watches can store, compute and analyze trillions of records from thousands of data sources, `devices will all communicate with APIs`. 

APIs need more infrastructure, and could probably stand more standardization. How cool would it be if APIs could not only talk to eachother, but learn eachothers methods, leaving the programmer to only get and send the data they need, without having to read the docucmentation on each API indivisually?

This means we should all build more APIs. Much like modules within code, or services within *nix operating systems, these APIs should do few things, do them well, and work together.
