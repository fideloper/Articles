#The rest of the idiots

> The Curse of Knowledge: when better-informed people find it extremely difficult to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed person.

Those who do not know how the web works, much less create an HTML page, view the web browser as magic. Many can't distinguish their web browser from a search engine.

People type what they are looking for and see web pages as a result. They have an internet connection and so they have the internet.

What is my point here? I think this thought came about because I was feeling frightened at the reality of how developers are `used`. Developres make things work, but the knowledge and craft that goes behind that is something people are truly ignorant about. As they should be. The uninitiated cannot know the hours of practice that the guitarist has done. The layman cannot possibly know the hours spent honing the skills and knowledge necessary to write quality code with few bugs.

This results in a curious situation for developers. They are seen as commodities. They are plots on a graph.

**Bias:**
	
	Where:
	t = time
	x = size of project
	n = number of developers
	
	The following is true:
	t = x/n
	
In this equation, development time is decreased by the number of developers on hand. If you have a large project, you simply need more developers.

This thinking dehumanizes developers and their craft. If developers are simply inputs, then hiring and firing them as needed is a low-cost, high-savings strategy.

**Bias:**

	Developers are not creative.

Programming is a craft; a honed skill. Experience makes you better. Education is constant. Programming is an art form. Learning techniques to solve common issues is exactly similar to artists learning techniques in shading to create realism.

**Bias:**

	Developers are the tool to make other peoples' big ideas
	
Developers are part of the team, just as your product manager, your marketing manager, and your design mananger come together to help shape the big ideas. Having knowledge on making the idea work only after the product, marketing and design makes for for **clusterfucks**. Developers are not merely implementors. They'll early input will make your big ideas run fluidly.

**Bias:**

	Developers love to solve problems
	
**Wrong.** Developers love being handed problems just as much as you do. Developers don't solve problems. `Developers craft solutions`.
